Here’s a reworded version for better flow:

**Title:** *Exploring Invertebrate Zoology Through Depth and Region: A Visualization of the Smithsonian's Kāne‘ohe Bay Collection*

**Research Questions:**
- How does the abundance of invertebrate species vary across phylum and class within the Smithsonian’s Kāne‘ohe Bay collection?
- How are these species distributed across different regions and depths in the bay?
- Can we identify patterns of species resilience or decline based on depth, collection date, or external stressors like human impact?

**Network Diagram:**
A network diagram will be used to map the relationships between phylum and class within the Kāne‘ohe Bay collection. This visualization is ideal for representing hierarchical relationships, where the size of each node reflects the number of images available. It allows users to interact with the diagram, exploring specific categories such as phylum, class, or even individual species in detail.

During my exploration of the Smithsonian’s Invertebrate Zoology collection, I encountered striking images of invertebrates collected from Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawaii. Delving deeper, I came across the study *"The Unnatural History of Kāne‘ohe Bay: Coral Reef Resilience in the Face of Centuries of Anthropogenic Impacts,"* which highlights the bay’s challenges, including:
- Dredging and filling (1939-1945)
- Increased sedimentation from urbanization
- Sewage discharge (1963-1979)
- Overfishing
- The introduction of invasive species

Despite these stressors, Kāne‘ohe Bay has shown remarkable resilience, with coral communities continuing to thrive. This inspired me to design a network diagram that visualizes the species collected from the bay. Each node represents a phylum or class, with node size corresponding to the number of images in the collection. Interactive tooltips will provide key details about each phylum and class, and users can toggle specific phyla for closer inspection. Additionally, users will be able to click into categories to explore images sorted by collection date or depth.

<h3>Option 2</h3>

**Title:** *Geography of Smithsonian's Invertebrate Zoology Collection*

**Linear Bubble Chart:**
<p>A Linear Bubble Chart groups the collection based on regions rather than species classification. This approach provides a high-level overview of the number of images available for each region, allowing users to click on a specific region to explore more detailed information. The chart emphasizes regional patterns and offers filtering options for both collection depth and date.

Rather than using a traditional map, this method organizes regions based on the invertebrate images, representing the number of images from each region as bubbles. Users can interact with the chart by clicking on regions to explore the collection further, accessing a similar interface as in Option 1. They will also be able to filter the data based on depth and collection date to gain deeper insights.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

**Title:** *Explroing Smithsonian's Invertebrate Zoology Collection Through Depth*

**Inverted Line Graph:**

<p>An Inverted Line Graph uses the y-axis to represent increasing depth, displayed from top to bottom. The size of the circles on the graph indicates the number of images collected at each depth. This method effectively visualizes how species distribution changes with depth, with larger circles representing a greater number of images.

For a more artistic approach, a Bathymetric Map could be used instead. In this design, rings on the map represent different depth levels, and overlaid circles show the number of images within each depth range. Both the inverted line graph and the bathymetric map allow users to explore species distribution by depth in an intuitive and visually engaging manner. Users will be able to click on various depths to further investigate the species and images collected from those levels.</p>
