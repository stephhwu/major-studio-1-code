<p>Title: Exploring Invertebrate Zoology Through Depth and Region: Visualizing the Smithsonian's Kāne‘ohe Bay Collection</p>

<p>Questions: How does the abundance of invertebrate species vary by phylum and class in the Smithsonian's Kāne‘ohe Bay collection?
How are these species distributed across different regions and depths in the bay?
Can we identify patterns of species resilience or decline based on depth, collection date, or external stressors such as human impact?</p>

<p>Network Diagram A network diagram is used to visualize the phylum and class relationships of species within the Kāne‘ohe Bay collection. This method is ideal because it can effectively represent hierarchical relationships, where node size corresponds to the number of available images. It also allows users to interact with the network to explore more specific categories such as phylum, class, or individual species details.</p>

<p>While exploring the Invertebrate Zoology collection, I came across stunning images of invertebrates collected from Kāne‘ohe Bay in Hawaii. Intrigued, I researched further and discovered a study titled *"The Unnatural History of Kāne‘ohe Bay: Coral Reef Resilience in the Face of Centuries of Anthropogenic Impacts."* The bay has faced numerous challenges, including:
Dredging and filling (1939-1945)
Increased sedimentation from urbanization
Sewage discharge (1963-1979)
Overfishing
The introduction of invasive species
Despite these stressors, the bay remains resilient, making it a key area for ongoing research, with coral communities continuing to thrive. I thought it would be compelling to create a network diagram visualizing the phylum and class of species from the Smithsonian's collection, where the size of each node corresponds to the number of images available. A tooltip could provide general information about each phylum and class, with an option to toggle and highlight specific phyla. Additionally, users would be able to click into categories to view the invertebrate images, sorted by collection date or depth.</p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>Linear Bubble Chart A linear bubble chart groups the collection based on regions rather than species classification. This is chosen to provide a high-level overview of how many images exist for each region, with users able to click through to explore more detailed information. It emphasizes regional patterns and allows filtering by collection depth and date.</p>

<p>Instead of using a map, I propose grouping regions based on the invertebrate images and using a linear bubble chart to represent the number of images per region. Users can click on each region to delve deeper, accessing a similar interface as in Option 1. This would allow them to explore the collection within each region, with filtering options for depth and collection date.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>Option 3 features an inverted line graph with the y-axis representing increasing depth from top to bottom. The size of the circles on the graph indicates the number of images at each depth. Alternatively, for a more artistic approach, I’m considering using bathymetric maps. In this design, rings on the map represent different depths, and a circle overlaid on the map shows the number of images for each depth range. Users could click on each visualization to explore the various depths in detail.</p>

<p>Inverted Line Graph An inverted line graph is used to represent species distribution by depth, with the y-axis inverted to display increasing depth from top to bottom. This method visualizes how species' presence changes with depth, where circle size corresponds to the number of images at each depth. Alternatively, a bathymetric map could be used to present a more artistic visualization, with contour rings representing depth and overlaid circles indicating the image count for each depth range. This provides a visually engaging and intuitive understanding of species depth distribution.</p>
