<h2>01B Concept & Sketches</h2>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>While exploring the Invertebrate Zoology collection, I came across stunning images of invertebrates collected from Kāne‘ohe Bay in Hawaii. Intrigued, I researched further and discovered a study titled *"The Unnatural History of Kāne‘ohe Bay: Coral Reef Resilience in the Face of Centuries of Anthropogenic Impacts."* The bay has faced numerous challenges, including:
Dredging and filling (1939-1945)
Increased sedimentation from urbanization
Sewage discharge (1963-1979)
Overfishing
The introduction of invasive species
Despite these stressors, the bay remains resilient, making it a key area for ongoing research, with coral communities continuing to thrive. I thought it would be compelling to create a network diagram visualizing the phylum and class of species from the Smithsonian's collection, where the size of each node corresponds to the number of images available. A tooltip could provide general information about each phylum and class, with an option to toggle and highlight specific phyla. Additionally, users would be able to click into categories to view the invertebrate images, sorted by collection date or depth.</p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>Instead of using a map, I propose grouping regions based on the invertebrate images and using a linear bubble chart to represent the number of images per region. Users can click on each region to delve deeper, accessing a similar interface as in Option 1. This would allow them to explore the collection within each region, with filtering options for depth and collection date.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>Option 3 features an inverted line graph with the y-axis representing increasing depth from top to bottom. The size of the circles on the graph indicates the number of images at each depth. Alternatively, for a more artistic approach, I’m considering using bathymetric maps. In this design, rings on the map represent different depths, and a circle overlaid on the map shows the number of images for each depth range. Users could click on each visualization to explore the various depths in detail.</p>
